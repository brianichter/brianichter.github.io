I'm a co-founder of [https://physicalintelligence.company/ Physical Intelligence (Pi)], where we are focused on bringing general-purpose AI into the physical world.
Generally, I'm interested in leveraging machine learning and large-scale models to enable robots to plan and perform general tasks in real-world environments.

Prior to founding Pi, I was a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Brain. Before that, I received a PhD and MS in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University and a BS in Aerospace Engineering and BA in Physics from the University of Virginia.
